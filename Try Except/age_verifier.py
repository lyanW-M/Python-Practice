# =====================================================================
# PROGRAM: Age verification
#           Verify the user's age is over 18 to give access (or deny access)
#           Keep asking for input until they've given a valid age
# =====================================================================

# VARIABLES
# TODO Create a variable for valid input and set it to false
# TODO Create a variable to old the user's age and set it to "" (blank)

# GET INPUT
# TODO Start a loop while the input is invalid

    # TODO Ask the user for their age and save it

    #TRY
    # TODO Create a try statement
        # TODO Change the input into an integer and resave it
        # TODO Set the valid input variable to true

    # FAIL TO CONVERT TO INTEGER
    # TODO Add an except statement
    # TODO Tell the user their input was invalid

# Unindented = Loop has finished so the input must be valid now

# CHECK AGE
# TODO Check if they are older than 18 and tell them they have access if they are
# TODO Check if they are older than 13 and tell them they have partial access if they are.
# TODO Otherwise tell them access has been denied


# ===================================================================
# EXTENSION
# Create a avatar creator for them to use if they get access. There should be 2 versions (full and partial)
# Eg. Full can choose: character class (warrior, rogue), hair colour, eye colour; partial
